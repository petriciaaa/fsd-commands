Make the Script Executable
Run the following command to make the script executable:
    
    ``` chmod +x make-slice.sh ```

Add the Script to Your PATH
Move the script to a directory that's in your PATH, or add its directory to your PATH. For example, you can move it to /usr/local/bin:

    ``` sudo mv make-slice.sh /usr/local/bin/make-slice ```

Make this script executable and move it to a directory in your PATH:

    ``` chmod +x fsd ```
    ``` sudo mv fsd /usr/local/bin/fsd ```


#Now you can run your command using:

    ``` fsd make-slice ```
```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```
